TEAM 6
Factors Affecting Car sales Volume between 2019 and 2020
   https://github.com/danawoodruff/carsales/blob/main/2020_Year_Of_Reckoning.pptx

Data Organization:
Project data is separated into four folders: "COVID_data", "Govt_Data", "CAR_sales_data", and "Stock_Data". 

Code organization:
"Working_Notebooks" is a folder containing the individual workbooks of team members. These notebooks were merged into a file named "Working_Master".

Plot formatting changes were made in the Working_Master along with minor edits. The images from the plots were saved in a folder named "Images".

The "Working_Master" was copied as "Master_Notebook".  Unused plots and code were culled.

Project Notes:
• COVID trend, Interest rate trend, Unemployment trend, and Consumer Sentiment trend were each visualized to easily observe which factors explain the change in consumer behavior towards car sales.  COVID, as the precipitating event, influenced each factor and effect examined.

• The team created weighted average indexes of the targeted twenty-one auto groups to compare to overall S&P 500 performance and to one another pre- and post- COVID.  The four indexes' performance differed from one another and from the S&P 500.
